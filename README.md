  Hey there! This is my first time doing Advent of Code, and I'm proud to have completed it!

  I've recently learnt a bit of JavaScript (aside from some basic Python a couple years back) and this was such a great opportunity to enhance 
and practise my coding skills while dealing with different problems! 

  Day 9 and 10 were particularly challenging for me, and I'll probably go back to this repository to refine my code in the future.
I'll definitely come back and try coding my own solver for Day 10 (hopefully) in the future. 

  Anyways, here's my solutions using vanilla JavaScript, and I hope you'll have a blast trying out the problems as well!

  Wishing you a Merry Christmas as well! (If you're reading this before the 25th)
